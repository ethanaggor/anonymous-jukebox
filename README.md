## About

In my digital audio production class, my teacher was having trouble trying to share student work anonymously.

This website serves as a solution where the teacher can:
* Import all student work from Google Drive (or a folder)
* Prompt students to log in to listen and provide feedback to individual songs
* Synchronously play student music submissions across students' computers
* See feedback submitted by classmates on each song
* Have all of the data exported to a centralized location (ie. spreadsheet)

### Tech Stack
